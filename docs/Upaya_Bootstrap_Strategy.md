# Upaya — Bootstrap vs Seed Analysis & Execution Plan

## The Verdict

Bootstrap to ₹3-5L MRR, then raise. Earn the right to raise.

## Why Bootstrap First

### What Seed Money Actually Buys (And Whether You Need It Day 1)

- 3 engineers for 12 months → No, need 1 engineer + founder for MVP
- Temple ops lead + travel → No, founder onboards first 10-15 temples personally
- Marketing budget ₹50L → No, free kundli SEO + WhatsApp virality is zero-cost
- Commerce inventory → No, start with puja bookings only
- Legal/compliance → Basic costs ₹1-2L, not ₹15L

### Real Cost of MVP

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|---|---|
| Founder (no salary) | ₹0 |
| 1 Full-stack engineer (or co-founder) | ₹80K-1.2L |
| AI/LLM API costs | ₹10-20K |
| Hosting | ₹5-10K |
| Swiss Ephemeris (kundli) | ₹0 (open source) |
| Temple travel | ₹15-20K |
| Domain, tools | ₹5K |
| **Total monthly burn** | **₹1.2-1.7L** |
| **6-month runway needed** | **₹7-10L** |

### Equity Math

- Raise ₹3 Cr now (just a plan) → ₹10-15 Cr valuation → give up 20-25%
- Raise ₹3 Cr at ₹5L MRR → ₹30-50 Cr valuation → give up 6-10%
- Saving 10-15% equity. On ₹500 Cr exit = ₹50-75 Cr difference.

### Why Bootstrap Fits Upaya Specifically

1. Revenue from report #1 (₹199 report costs ₹5 to generate — 97% margin)
2. Faith businesses need authenticity, not speed. VC pressure to "scale fast" = cut corners = lose trust
3. Temple partnerships are relationship-driven not capital-driven
4. AstroTalk threat is slower than feared (busy with IPO prep, offline stores, Series B)

## Bootstrap Execution Path

```
Month 0-1: Build (₹1.5L)
- You + 1 engineer: AI chat + kundli + diagnosis + paid report
- Tech: Next.js + React Native + Claude API + Swiss Ephemeris

Month 1-2: Validate (₹2L)
- Launch on Product Hunt, Reddit, WhatsApp groups
- Free kundli hook → paid report monetization
- Visit 10 temples personally
- Target: 200+ reports sold, 5-10 temple LOIs

Month 2-4: First Revenue (₹3-4L)
- Puja bookings live at 10-15 temples
- SEO starts ranking
- Target: ₹1-3L MRR, 1,000+ paying users

Month 4-6: Prove It
- ₹3-5L MRR, 25+ temples, 3,000+ paying users, 20%+ repeat
- NOW raise with proof at 3-5x better valuation
```

## The Hybrid Path (If Needed)

Raise ₹25-50L from 2-3 angels:

- **Angel #1 (spiritual/temple connections):** ₹10-15L — temple intros, credibility
- **Angel #2 (consumer-tech founder):** ₹10-15L — product advice, hiring network
- **Angel #3 (NRI):** ₹10-15L — NRI market access
- **Total:** ₹30-45L at ₹5-8 Cr valuation (5-8% equity)
- 12-15 months runway, 3 advisors, no VC pressure

## Decision Framework

```
Can you survive 6 months with ₹7-10L savings?
├── YES → Can you code?
│   ├── YES → Bootstrap 100%
│   └── NO → Find technical co-founder → Bootstrap together
└── NO → Raise ₹30-50L angel round (find technical co-founder too)
         ↓
    Hit ₹3-5L MRR (Month 4-6)
         ↓
    Raise seed at 3-5x better valuation
```
