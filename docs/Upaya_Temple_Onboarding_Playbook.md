# Upaya — Temple Onboarding Playbook (No Network Required)

## Why Small Temples > Big Temples

| Big Temple | Small Temple |
|---|---|
| Government trust, committee approvals | One head pujari decides |
| Already have digital systems | Zero digital presence — you're their first |
| Don't need your revenue | Hungry for incremental income |
| 6-12 month onboarding cycle | Can say yes in one meeting |
| You're one of 50 pitching | First person offering this |

## Which Temples to Target

Sweet spot: spiritually reputed but digitally invisible.

### Best Categories

- **Dosha-specific temples** (Shani, Mangal, Rahu-Ketu) — directly tied to AI remedy prescriptions
- **Navagraha temples** — 9-planet circuits in TN, MP
- **Shakti Peethas (smaller ones)** — high devotion, low digital presence
- **Kashi ghats temples** — hundreds of small temples, tourists + NRIs want access
- **Ujjain temples** — beyond Mahakaleshwar, dozens of smaller significant temples
- **Haridwar/Rishikesh ashram temples** — used to external devotees

### First 10 Targets

1. Shani temple in Ujjain (not Shani Shingnapur — smaller one)
2. Hanuman temple in Varanasi (dozens along ghats)
3. Navagraha temple in South Indian town
4. Kaal Bhairav temple (Varanasi or Ujjain)
5. Baglamukhi temple in Haridwar (popular for legal/enemy problems)
6. Mangalnath temple in Ujjain (Mangal dosha specific)
7. Small Lakshmi temple (financial remedy)
8. Durga temple in Bengal or Varanasi
9. Rahu-Ketu specific temple in South India

## First Contact (Phone Script)

> "Namaste ji. Mera naam [X] hai. Main ek app bana raha hoon jisse door-door ke bhakt online puja book kar sakein aur prasad ghar baithe receive kar sakein. Bahut se log [dosha] ke liye aapke mandir mein puja karana chahte hain lekin aa nahi paate. Kya main aapke baare mein baat kar sakta hoon? Main [city] aa raha hoon next week."

90% will say "come talk to me."

## In-Person Visit Protocol

### DO:

- Visit as devotee first — darshan, sit for aarti
- Dress appropriately (kurta, not jeans-tshirt)
- Bring small offering (fruit, flowers)
- Speak Hindi/local language
- Ask about temple history, deity, pujari's lineage
- Show genuine respect and interest
- Spend 2-3 hours at the temple

### DON'T:

- Walk in with laptop and pitch deck
- Talk about "tech platform" or "startup"
- Mention revenue in first conversation
- Speak in English
- Rush
- Treat it as business meeting

## The Pitch (After Building Rapport)

> "Pujari ji, bahut log hain jo aapke mandir mein puja karana chahte hain lekin doosre sheher mein rehte hain. NRI log bhi hain jo India aana nahi paate. Agar main ek system banaun jahan log online puja book karen, aap sankalp ke saath puja karein, main video bhejun aur prasad courier karun — toh aapko zyada se zyada bhakt mil sakte hain bina kisi extra mehnat ke."

What you're really saying:

- More devotees (spiritual motivation)
- More dakshina income (practical motivation)
- Zero extra work (they just do what they already do)

## Deal Structure

| Term | Offer |
|---|---|
| Revenue split | Temple gets 65-70%, Upaya keeps 30-35% |
| Temple does | Performs puja with sankalp, packs prasad |
| Upaya does | Booking, payment, video coordination, shipping, user communication |
| Video | Pujari's assistant records 2-3 min on smartphone, WhatsApps to you |
| Prasad | Simple box, local courier picks up, Shiprocket/Delhivery handles shipping |
| Start small | 1-2 pujas/week, scale with demand |
| No exclusivity initially | Just ask to be listed |

### Pujari's Math

10 pujas/month x ₹1,100 avg = ₹11,000/month extra income. For pujari earning ₹15-25K from walk-ins, this is 40-70% income increase for zero extra effort.

## Have This Ready Before Traveling

Working demo on phone showing:

1. AI chat: "User says marriage is delayed"
2. Kundli generation
3. Diagnosis: "Shani in 7th house"
4. Remedy: "Recommends puja at YOUR temple, pujari ji"
5. What user sees: booking flow, payment, video + prasad delivery

When pujari sees **his temple on your screen**, he gets it immediately.

## Key Reassurances

- Users don't care about temple size. They care that puja was performed with their name at a real temple with video proof.
- A 200-year-old Shani temple in Ujjain is MORE authentic than a commercialized big temple.
- First 10 = your legs. Next 50 = their referrals. Next 200 = inbound + scouts. Next 500 = Temple CMS self-serve.
- Utsav onboarded 400 temples. DevDham onboarded 5,000. Both started from zero. You can too.
